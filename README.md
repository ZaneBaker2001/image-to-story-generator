# Image-to-Story Generator

A Vision-Language Model (VLM) that takes an image as input and generates a short, coherent, and imaginative story based on its visual content.

## Overview

This project combines a vision encoder (ResNet50) with a language model (GPT-2) to form a lightweight, powerful VLM pipeline. A linear projection bridges the vision features to GPT-2's embedding space, enabling creative and descriptive story generation from images.

-  GPT-2 decoder for text generation
-  Learnable mapper between image and text embeddings
-  Simple training loop on custom datasets
-  Generates creative stories from any image
-  Plug-and-play inference with a single command

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-to-story.git
cd image-to-story
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Data

Put your images in the `data/images/` folder.

Create a `data/stories.txt` file (tab-separated format):

```
dog.jpg    A small dog runs through a sunny field, chasing butterflies.
cat.jpg    A curious cat climbs a tree, watching birds fly above.
car.jpg    A red sports car speeds down a desert highway under the setting sun.
```

Make sure image names match exactly.

---

## Training

```bash
python train.py
```

Model will be saved as `vlm_model.pt`.

---

## Generating Stories

```bash
python generate.py data/images/dog.jpg
```

Output:
```
Generated Story:
A playful puppy dashes across the green meadow, thrilled by the fluttering butterflies.
```
